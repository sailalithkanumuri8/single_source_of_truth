Joshua said he needs more time to look at the data, but so far he hasn't been able to find anything suspicious in the .har file. He also needs to sync with his teammate, Christian Guzman Loza who's been owning a previous escalation of this issue at sev 3. We've agreed that the best course of action is to set a reconvene for 9:30am PDT, to allow the OCEs some time to sync on this issue before they can provide us with an update.  In the meanwhile,  Dario Galante (CSS) is still working on getting SAP's support case to sev A. This has been raised to us as a PSI at sev 2 saying 10s of tenants are impacted, however after asking Dario whether he can get us a list of impacted tenants and support cases, he only knew about one more support case from a non-OED tenant, which we don't have confirmation from PG on this being the same issue as SAP is facing.  At this point in time, we're not yet sure about this being a service-side issue, that's why no communications have been sent out. We need PG (Centralized Deployment) to confirm whether this is a service side issue or not before sending out communications. SAP ACE Tosin Ojekale has been brought up to speed on the issue as well.
