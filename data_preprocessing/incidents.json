Affected Tenants: mastercard.onmicrosoft.com/ Issue Problem Description: Emails are not refreshing automatically in Outlook Web Access (OWA). Users need to manually click the folder to see new emails or the updated count. This issue does not occur in Outlook Desktop, where emails show up properly. Since multiple users are using this workaround is not an option for us.  User Affected: Bindu Sagar Ojha and other users using the shared mailbox L1_support_C& Forest: exchange/namprd14-005-01  Business Impact: All users using the shared mailbox are impacted, causing delays in email communication and workflow disruptions.  Troubleshooting:  Verified that the issue occurs in OWA but not in Outlook Desktop. Sent test email to the shared mailbox, which shows up automatically in Outlook but requires manual refresh in OWA or click on any other folder then click back on inbox. Checked mailbox statistics and confirmed that the inbox folder is under the limit. Logs collected include PPT and HAR files. Same behavior when we add shared mailbox as Additional mailbox or add as additional mailbox/folder in same OWA session. Same issue on different computers and different browsers.

User Affected:  Room Mailbox ID: Delegate: Forest: exchange/namprd19-002-01  Business Impact: Important meeting is getting missed as Organized doesn't get approval message. Delegates thinks they have approved. Unless they refresh OWA/Outlook. Status remained same.  Troubleshooting:   Room Mailbox delegates approved meeting is not getting processed. Once they approved we see call like https://outlook.office.com/owa/service.svc?action=RespondToMeetingMessage&app=Mail&n=66 However, if we refresh OWA it again shows accept,Decline options. Same issue happening from OWA and Outlook Both. We have tried removing and readding delegates. They informed it happening with multiple room mailboxes. They tried adding different users as delegate issue remained same. Tried to toggle Automateprocessing and still no change. Compared settings from lab and did not find any issue.  Room Mailbox ID: Delegate: As per har logs: We see response 200ok. Same as per lab repro in customer case. However, we see no update in customer case . Also, Organizer do not see acceptance that meeting is accepted by delegate. Customer tried to check in room mailbox and it doesn't show its approved.  We do not see this event for Delegate in customer case if response is sent:IPM.Schedule.Meeting.Resp.Pos. We see IPM.Schedule.Meeting.Resp.Pos in Delegate CDL in lab repro.

Getting the same error when agenda is added and you attempt to send the invite. In the other escalation, we see a sensitivity label was applied to the agenda/loop as soon as it was added.

We've sent and RA to Centralized Deplyoment as we haven't heard back from  Joshua Turpen (Centralized Deployment OCE) on his investigation of the customer provided data. Joshua said he needs more time to look at the data, but so far he hasn't been able to find anything suspicious in the .har file. He also needs to sync with his teammate, Christian Guzman Loza who's been owning a previous escalation of this issue at sev 3. We've agreed that the best course of action is to set a reconvene for 9:30am PDT, to allow the OCEs some time to sync on this issue before they can provide us with an update.  In the meanwhile,  Dario Galante (CSS) is still working on getting SAP's support case to sev A. This has been raised to us as a PSI at sev 2 saying 10s of tenants are impacted, however after asking Dario whether he can get us a list of impacted tenants and support cases, he only knew about one more support case from a non-OED tenant, which we don't have confirmation from PG on this being the same issue as SAP is facing.  At this point in time, we're not yet sure about this being a service-side issue, that's why no communications have been sent out. We need PG (Centralized Deployment) to confirm whether this is a service side issue or not before sending out communications. SAP ACE Tosin Ojekale has been brought up to speed on the issue as well.
