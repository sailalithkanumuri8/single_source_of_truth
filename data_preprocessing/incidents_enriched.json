Root Cause : A previous change (over a year ago) made to fix a bug was for MOS API to call RemoveApp on EXO services.  But this fails for Org apps with Available or Optional flag. How Mitigated : A previous change (over a year ago) made to fix a bug was for MOS API to call RemoveApp on EXO services.  But this fails for Org apps with Available or Optional flag.

At this point in time, we're not yet sure about this being a service-side issue, that's why no communications have been sent out.

David Domonkos 6/19/2025 2:18 AM Support case is at sev B, Dario Galante (CSS) is going to be working internally on raising the case to sev A to get proper engineering traction. Joshua Turpen (Centralized Deployment OCE) is looking into the data that has been already provided by the customer, however as he has no previous insight into this escalation, he needs some time to troubleshoot.  We're also waiting for Christian Guzman (Centralized Deployment) to come online (during Redmond hours), as he's worked and owned this escalation at sev 3 level and see, whether he has any updates. Dario (CSS) confirmed that no updates have been shared by PG since early May, and the customer is growing impatient.

We've sent and RA to Centralized Deplyoment as we haven't heard back from  Joshua Turpen (Centralized Deployment OCE) on his investigation of the customer provided data. Joshua said he needs more time to look at the data, but so far he hasn't been able to find anything suspicious in the .har file. He also needs to sync with his teammate, Christian Guzman Loza who's been owning a previous escalation of this issue at sev 3. We've agreed that the best course of action is to set a reconvene for 9:30am PDT, to allow the OCEs some time to sync on this issue before they can provide us with an update.  In the meanwhile,  Dario Galante (CSS) is still working on getting SAP's support case to sev A. This has been raised to us as a PSI at sev 2 saying 10s of tenants are impacted, however after asking Dario whether he can get us a list of impacted tenants and support cases, he only knew about one more support case from a non-OED tenant, which we don't have confirmation from PG on this being the same issue as SAP is facing.  At this point in time, we're not yet sure about this being a service-side issue, that's why no communications have been sent out. We need PG (Centralized Deployment) to confirm whether this is a service side issue or not before sending out communications. SAP ACE Tosin Ojekale has been brought up to speed on the issue as well.
